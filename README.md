## B.Tech Course Project : Aircraft Design (AEB 4341, AEB 4433)

– Crafted a design plan for a business jet with a 6-8 passenger capacity, 3,500 km range, and 800 km/h cruise speed. Created comparative data sheets and plots in Excel, selecting the most effective design parameters and geometry.
– Assessed load distribution and flight performance using suitable plots. Designed and assessed geometry and structural components with SolidWorks, ANSYS Fluent, and ANSYS Static Structural
